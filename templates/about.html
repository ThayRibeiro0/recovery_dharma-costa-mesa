    <h1>About Recovery Dharma Costa Mesa</h1>

    <p>
      My name is <strong>Maher</strong>, and I’m one of the original facilitators of the Recovery Dharma Costa Mesa
      group. Our journey began during my time in treatment at <em>Barn Life</em>, where I connected with friends also
      seeking healing and transformation.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of our friends had started a Refuge Recovery meeting and introduced us to the idea. From there, we discovered
      <a href="https://recoverydharma.org/" target="_blank">Recovery Dharma</a> — a Buddhist-inspired approach to
      recovery that deeply resonated with us.
    </p>

    <p>
      I shared the idea with others at Barn Life, and they were excited about hosting a Recovery Dharma meeting on-site.
      Using the resources and guidance provided by the Recovery Dharma community, we began holding weekly meetings that
      quickly grew in depth and connection.
    </p>

    <p>
      We enjoyed a beautiful season of gathering together at Barn Life. Eventually, I found myself holding the space
      alone for a while, and when I asked for support, the community responded with open hearts — and the group began to
      grow once more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our meetings were later relocated to a new home, and today, we are honored to hold space at the <strong>Higashi
        Honganji Buddhist Temple</strong> in Costa Mesa — a peaceful and welcoming environment for our sangha.
    </p>

    <p>
      The group is now held regularly with the support of compassionate facilitators, including <strong>Tommy</strong>,
      <strong>Andrea</strong>, and <strong>Nick</strong>, who bring their own wisdom, presence, and kindness to our
      meetings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recovery Dharma Costa Mesa is grounded in meditation, self-inquiry, shared wisdom, and a strong sense of
      community. Everyone is welcome — wherever you are on your journey, know that you are not alone.
